# **Capstone Project: Question Difficulty Classification**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies the difficulty of a given question by predicting its **grade level (3rd‚Äì12th)**. Future enhancements aim to include **Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy levels**, enabling the model to estimate cognitive complexity as well.

The architecture is inspired by *"Question Difficulty Estimation Based on Attention Model for Question Answering"* by Hyun-Je Song, Su-Hwan Yoon, and Seong-Bae Park.

The project is implemented in **PyTorch**, with heavy customization to the BERT architecture through a **Dual Attention Mechanism (DualBert)**. Code includes inline references to PyTorch documentation where appropriate.

---

## **Key Features**
- üîÅ **Custom BERT Architecture**: Implements a dual self-attention mechanism (`DualBertModel`) to better capture question semantics.
- üß† **Grade-Level Classification**: Predicts question difficulty as one of ten grade levels (3rd to 12th).
- üßÆ **Custom Dataset Integration**: Uses a dataset of Common Core-aligned questions labeled by grade.
- üìä **Evaluation**: Tracks accuracy and loss across multiple training sessions.
- üöÄ **Streamlit App**: Deploy the trained model via an interactive UI to classify user-input questions in real-time.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit  
- **Models & Architectures**: BERT, Dual Attention (custom), Multiclass Classification  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (for training), Streamlit (for deployment)

## **Data**
- üìö **RACE Dataset** (original benchmark from the paper)  
  - [Hugging Face RACE Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/1704.04683)

- üìò **QxGrade Dataset** (custom dataset curated from Common Core-aligned educational material)  
  - [Kaggle: QxGrade Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/coreyjjness94/qxgrade-dataset)

- ü§ñ **Pretrained Model**  
  - [Hugging Face: Studybot](https://huggingface.co/Coreyjness/Studybot)  
    Achieves ~70% accuracy on unseen grade-level questions.

## **How to Use the Project**

Follow the instructions below to train your own model or run the pre-trained classifier using Streamlit.

### üß∞ Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Resources**  
   - If training: download `QxGrade_Dataset.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/coreyjjness94/qxgrade-dataset)  
   - If deploying: download `Bert_Classifier.pt` from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Coreyjness/Studybot)
<br>
2. **Clone the Repository and Set Up Your Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coreyjness/studybot_da_capstone.git
   cd studybot_da_capstone
   ```
<br>
3. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
<br>
4. **Install Required Libraries**

    You can install the dependencies based on your system:
    
    üîπ CPU-only  
    If you're running on a regular laptop or desktop without a dedicated NVIDIA GPU (note: training will not run on most CPUs:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    üîπ GPU Acceleration (NVIDIA with CUDA 11.8)
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt
    ```
<br>
5. **Launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line to Train a New Model**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
<br>
6. **Train the Classifier**
   - Open `capstonev2.ipynb`
   - Run through the notebook to load and preprocess the dataset, fine-tune the `DualBertModel`, and save the resulting model as `Bert_Classifier.pt`
<br>
7. **Launch the Classifier with Streamlit**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
